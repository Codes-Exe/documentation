# Use Cases

## Cloud build system with support for large projects

If you're building large projects, many Cloud CI/CD services will not offer the large disc space needed for game development. Cloud Builder offers support for massive projects and optimizes the cost well with caching. Even very large projects are not particularly expensive.

## Flexible burst workloads

Cloud Builder's powerful caching gives it the ability to accelerate scale-up to large numbers of tasks much faster than a dedicated server. With Cloud Builder, you can scale up to massive numbers of builds and back down to zero as needed on-demand.

**This gives you the flexibility to forget about your build system and focus on what you're building.**

Most automated workloads fluctuate dramatically over a project's lifespan, especially if one is successful and needs to evolve rapidly.

Forecasting the number of dedicated build machines that will be required, estimating their specs, managing caching for multiple servers, and scaling dedicated machines up and out can be a significant time investment, many projects realize this late in development.

Not being able to quickly deliver CI/CD capabilities to any project or tool in an organization can significantly drag your ability to be agile and deliver quickly.

Burst capabilities ensure you can always deliver builds reliably, repeatably and consistently. You can always add dedicated servers later to have a hybrid model, to optimize high usage costs.

## Fast via powerful automatic caching

Cloud Builder caches git LFS/large files and your Unity Library folder into Cloud storage to make builds as fast as possible.

This reduces bandwidth costs of storing huge projects and speeds up startup times significantly.

The caching is completely automatic and you do not need to manually manage any aspect of it. You can view or export the cache easily. You can also restore an old backup of a cache if you need to wipe the system and start again for any reason.
